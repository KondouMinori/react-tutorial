Mozart composed this song \r\n               in Vienna when he was 25. It is bright and light song, \r\n               There is a lot of interaction between \r\n               the first and second pianos, \r\n               which is fun for the performer but difficult to match.\r\n               Recently, I have created a new way of enjoying playing\r\n               the second piano by recording the first piano\r\n               with an electronic piano.\r\n\r\n           </p>\r\n           <figure className=\"image is-2by3\">\r\n            <img src={pic1} alt=\"mozart\"></img>\r\n        </figure>\r\n        </article>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"tile is-parent\">\r\n        <article className=\"tile is-child box\">\r\n           <p class=\"title\">My Favorite Classic2</p>\r\n           <p class=\"subtitle\">\r\n                Next, I recommend \r\n                Piano Sonata No. 8 in C Minor, Op. 13 'Pathetique' \r\n                by Beethoven. This song is composed from 1798 \r\n                to 1799. It's a slow and painful song.\r\n                The image of sunset is perfect for this song.\r\n                There is Adagio cantabile, which means to sing gently.\r\n                There are some difficult parts, but it is easy to try \r\n                because the tempo is slow and \r\n                the length of the song is short.\r\n                It's a very nice song that will cleanse our heart.\r\n           </p>\r\n           <figure className=\"image is-2by3\">\r\n            <img src={pic2} alt=\"beethoven\"></img>\r\n        </figure>\r\n        </article>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div className=\"tile is-parent\">\r\n      <article className=\"tile is-child box\">\r\n        <p class=\"title\">Recommend</p>\r\n        <p class=\"subtitle\">\r\n            There is drama that is perfect for enjoying \r\n            classical music.
